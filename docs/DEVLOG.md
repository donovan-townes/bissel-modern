# bissel-modern Development Log

High-level log of major steps taken while building this project.  
This is not a detailed changelog; it’s a *narrative of progress* for future developers and my future self.

## WPT-01 — Bootstrap

### MO-01.1 — New Repo & Scaffold

- [x] Created repo `bissel-modern`.
- [x] Initialized `npm init -y`.
- [x] Added ESLint + Prettier.
- [x] Added `.env.example`, `.gitignore`.
- [x] Stubbed `README.md` + `RUNBOOK.md`.

- [x] Added `config.json` for role names, prefixes, guild IDs, level curve.
- [x] Added dotenv for secrets.
- [x] Verified bot boots with interaction + message gateway intents.
- [x] Verified bot connects to Discord.

### MO-01.3 — Personality Lift
