      "The parchment accepts your name, the ledger accepts your debt, and destiny sighs audibly. Gear up, keep receipts, and remember: I balance the books even when you donâ€™t.",
      "Your entry is clean; it wonâ€™t stay that way. Missions blot pages, gold stains margins, and victories crease corners. Keep me updated and Iâ€™ll keep you official.",
      "Iâ€™ve filed you under â€˜Promising, Possibly Chaotic.â€™ Treasure converts to tidy numbers; trouble converts to longer entries. Bring me both, and weâ€™ll get along.",
      "Welcome to the guild bureaucracy masquerading as heroism. You bring the feats; Iâ€™ll bring the ink. Together we make historyâ€”or at least legible notes."
